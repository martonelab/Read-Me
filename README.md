# Read-Me
for first time users of the Lab github (how to use github, folder and data organization)

# Purpose
Github was established as a for all code and programming knowledge sharing within the lab which includes:
- repository for data associated with publications
- code to update the PTM masterlist
- code to format records and send to BOLD
- lesson material for learning `dplyr` and `ggplot`

# What is git/github?
- **Git** is the version control software that keeps track of the changes you make to documents (kind of like track changes in Word but less cumbersome)
- **Github** is the site you can host your version controlled material (think a more powerful and flexible version of Google Drive)
- request to be added to the lab github to start contributing!

# Using the Lab Github
- it is **not** for unpublished data
- everything is public on this account, for private repositories please use personal accounts then share with the Lab account when the publication is public
- Feel free to download - `fork` over repositories and play around with the material

# Useful files in this repo
- `github.rmd` for setting up your computer for git/github
- `repository organization` for a guide on how to make a new repository in the Lab
