### Make your own repo

## Using the Martone Lab repositories
#### Just downloading the file
1. Go to https://github.com/martonelab
2. Go to the Read-Me repository
3. Click the green button to download the zipfile on to your computer

## (12) Setting up Rstudio integration
#### Fork over a repo
1. Go to https://github.com/martonelab
2. Go to the Read-Me repository
3. Click Fork (makes a copy to your GitHub Account)
- allows people to attribute credit 
- tracks changes
- your changes will not be integrated until you say so
- it's like making alternative universes and timelines (less of a concern for less complicated projects)
4. Clone your repository
_Pro tip_ 
- make a directory (ie. tmp) where it is easy to add all your github repos to 
- you should be removing the repo when you are done with it as good practice
- pull the repo down to your computer when you need it

#### Add changes easily

__Pro tip __ Try following chapter 10 to cache your credentials to avoid logging in each time you push or pull to github - https://happygitwithr.com/credential-caching.html#credential-caching

Congrats! Now you can push new lesson repos into the Lab github and pull lessons people have made available!
